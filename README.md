OArepo Validate library for model-level matedata validation


## Installation

```bash
    pip install oarepo-validate
```

## Usage

The library provides mixins for enforcing json schema and marshmallow validation.

### JSON schema validation

If ``$schema`` is present on metadata, invenio performs a json schema validation inside
the ``validate()`` method. The problem is that ``$schema`` can be set/removed via the REST
API. This means that an ill-written client can completely bypass the validation.

To mitigate this issue, create your own Record implementation:

```python
from oarepo_validate import SchemaKeepingRecordMixin
from invenio_records import Record

class MyRecord(SchemaKeepingRecordMixin, Record):
    ALLOWED_SCHEMAS = ('records/record-v1.0.0.json', 'records/record-v2.0.0.json')
    PREFERRED_SCHEMA = 'records/record-v2.0.0.json'
```

And register the record in REST endpoints in configuration:

```python
RECORD_PID = 'pid(recid,record_class="my:MyRecord")'

RECORDS_REST_ENDPOINTS = {
    'records': dict(
        pid_type='recid',
        pid_minter='recid',
        pid_fetcher='recid',
        record_class='my:MyRecord',
        item_route='/records/<{0}:pid_value>'.format(RECORD_PID),
        # ...
    )
}
```

#### Create record

When creating a new record, if ``$schema`` is not set, ``MyRecord.PREFERRED_SCHEMA`` is added
automatically. If ``$schema`` is set, it is validated against ``MyRecord.ALLOWED_SCHEMAS``
and an exception is raised if the schema is not present in ``ALLOWED_SCHEMAS``.

#### PUT / PATCH record

Before the result of the operation is committed, ``$schema`` is checked again.

### Marshmallow validation

In invenio, REST create operation use the following sequence:

```
<flask>
<invenio_records_rest.views.RecordsListResource:post>
   <loader>
      <marshmallow>
   <permission factory>
   <pid minter>
   <record_class.create>
      <record.commit>
         <record.validate>
```

REST PUT operation then uses:

```
<flask>
<invenio_records_rest.views.RecordResource:put>
   <permission factory>
   <loader>
      <marshmallow>
   <record.update>
   <record.commit>
      <record.validate>
```

REST PATCH operation:

```
<flask>
<invenio_records_rest.views.RecordResource:put>
   <permission factory>
   <simple json loader>
   <record.patch>
   <record.commit>
      <record.validate>
```

As you can see, if you place any validation code in loader's marshmallow, it is not executed.
An alternative is to have the validation code in ``validate`` and handle all validations there.
This library does exactly this - it provides a record mixin that calls marshmallow schema's ``load``
method inside its ``validate`` method.

#### Usage

Create your own record and inherit from the mixin:

```python
from oarepo_validate import MarshmallowValidatedRecordMixin
from invenio_records import Record
from marshmallow import Schema, fields

class TestSchema(Schema):
    name = fields.Str(required=True)

class MyRecord(MarshmallowValidatedRecordMixin, Record):
    MARSHMALLOW_SCHEMA = TestSchema
```

Do not forget to register it as in the previous example.

Now marshmallow schema will be processed before each ``commit`` method.

#### What about marshmallow in loader?

In most cases, marshmallow schema in loader can be removed and a simple json loader used instead.
However, if you need a custom processing of input data that is independent of validation,
you can keep the two marshmallows. To achieve this, use ``oarepo_validate.json_loader``
as the record loader.

```python
RECORDS_REST_ENDPOINTS = {
    'recid': dict(
        record_loaders={
            'application/json': 'oarepo_validate:json_loader',
        },
        # ...
    )
}
```

A special case is when the marshmallow in loader already includes validation marshmallow rules.
Then you would want to use loader's marshmallow for create / replace and marshmallow in validation
only for patch operation (so that the same marshmallow rules are not called twice). To accomplish
this, set:

```python
class MyRecord(MarshmallowValidatedRecordMixin, Record):
    MARSHMALLOW_SCHEMA = TestSchema

    VALIDATE_MARSHMALLOW = False
    VALIDATE_PATCH = True
```

``VALIDATE_MARSHMALLOW`` will switch off marshmallow validation in ``validate`` method and
``VALIDATE_PATCH`` will switch on marshmallow validation in ``patch`` method.

#### Context

Marshmallow validation is called with a context, that is filled with:

  * ``record``
  * ``pid`` if it is known
  * Any ``**kwargs`` passed to ``Record.create`` or ``Record.commit``

#### Signals

The library provides the following signals:

```python
before_marshmallow_validate = signal('oarepo_before_marshmallow_validate')
"""
Signal invoked before record metadata are validated (loaded by marshmallow schema)
inside Record.validate

:param source:  the record being validated
:param record:  the record being validated
:param context: marshmallow context
:param **kwargs: kwargs passed to Record.create or Record.commit (or Record.validate)
"""

after_marshmallow_validate = signal('oarepo_after_marshmallow_validate')
"""
Signal invoked after record metadata are validated (loaded by marshmallow schema)
inside Record.validate

:param source:  the record being validated
:param record:  the record that was successfully validated
:param context: marshmallow context
:param result:  result of load that will be used to update record's metadata.
                Signal handler can modify it.
:param **kwargs: kwargs passed to Record.create or Record.commit (or Record.validate)
"""
```
